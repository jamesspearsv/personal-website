          Hi! I'm a public librarian, hobbyist web developer, and full-time cat enthusiast. Born and raised in East           Tennessee, I now call wild and wonderful West Virginia home, where I live with my wife and our two cats. I hold a BA in History and an MS in Information Sciences from the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, graduating in 2020 and 2022, respectively.
        </p>
        <p>
         During my master's program, I worked in various libraries including the Marion County Public Library System in Fairmont, WV and West Virginia University Libraries in Morgantown, WV. Today, I serve as the Assistant Director of the Morgantown Public Library System where I oversee daily operations at the Morgantown Public Library and contribute to advancing the library system's mission.
        </p>
        <p>
   Beyond the library, I'm passionate about web development, coding, and computer science. I enjoy self-directed learning and have completed courses like Harvard's CS50 and The Odin Project. Iâ€™m always exploring new tools and concepts, from JavaScript and React to Linux, Python, and Docker, and love finding ways to merge my tech skills with library work. I view every day is an opportunity to learn and grow!
